Memory Budget
========================
Mono images, 1bpp. Store pixels in 1 byte pieces, 8 pixels per byte.
On a 1GB GPU, use 1000MB for image max and 3KB for error storage (may be too large).
In 1000MB: 1,000,000,000 pixels can be stored, 31,662 pixels on a side.

Dimensions of CIF in actual size, units: 429,348 * 429,346 = 185 billion uni^2
lambda is 40. (CMF layer had 120 distance; so 120/3=40). Inspecting CMF, 120 units. (Used ChipDisplay). 120/3=lambda is 40 for this chip
Minimum scale factor is 1/14, at that size lambda is 2.8 pixels. 1/14 *is* a safe lambda.

	1polyedge at 20
	1polyedge at 140
	: pass matrix, pass pixel

	20/14=1.43	 1
	140/14=10	10
	120/14=8.57	 8

	1polyedge at 20
	1polyedge at 120
	: pass matrix, nonpass pixel

If it's larger, you can check chunks of the chip at a time. Note: advanced feature, I won't be getting to this before the science fair. Put it in the paper tho.

Benchmark: find the curve for data copies onto the GPU.

It should work as such:
	Decide on a region to check
	Iterate through all items in the list, run overlap test
	Draw specified objects at a good resolution
	Copy image to GPU and check
	Repeat until all regions have been completed.
